    "Supervised learning: the training data are already \"labeled\" with the solutions. Classification and regression (for prediction) are examples of tasks. The most important algorithms for supervised learning are:\n",

    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "- Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "- Neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning: the training data are unlabeled, the algorithm learns without a \"supervisor\". Examples of tasks are clustering, anomaly detection, associate rule learning, amongst many others. Some important unsupervised learning algorithms are:\n",
    "- Clustering\n",
    " - K-Means\n",
    " - DBSCAN\n",
    " - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\n",

    "\n",
    "Batch learning: system is incapable of learning incrementally, must be trained on all the data at once, hence \"offline\", before being launched into production. Good if system doesn't need to be updated \"on the fly\". Even once a day or week updates are ok. Each update/learning instance requires all the data, so it must all be kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning: system is fed data sequentially, keeping each learning step fast and cheap. Good when data is received continuously and system needs to change rapidly or autonomously. Data can also be discarded once system has trained on it. Learning rate affects the memory of the system, and the sensitivity to new data."
